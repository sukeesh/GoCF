**How to install it?** <br>
* copy `gocf` and `incf` file to `/bin/` directory <br>
* give permissions to them by `sudo chmod 755 /bin/gocf` and `sudo chmod 755 /bin/incf` <br>
* Now create a directory in your `home` folder and name it `GoCF` <br>
* copy `Parse.py` from `GoCF_files` to `GoCF` and if neccessary do `chmod` <br>

**How to use it?** <br>
* After the contest begins, fire up your terminal and type `incf` <br>
* Now, enter the contest code <br>
* GoCF will now download the test cases for you! <br>
* Now, for example let us take contest code as `624` and name your problems as `624_A.cpp`, `624_B.cpp`, ... ( Case sensitive )<br>
* Code in your favourite editor ( subl / vim / .. ) or even ide !<br>
* Compile <br>
* now, for testing your solution just `gocf 624_A.cpp` <br>

**That's it!**<br>
